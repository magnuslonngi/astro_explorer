# Interactive VR Learning App

We developed an Interactive App focused on learning using virtual reality, which uses resources provided in the challenge.

We began with an investigation into the data obtained by the NASA, later that we divided the project into different categories, such as:
- Research and analysis of resources.
- Data Collection and Processing using Python
- Elaboration and App design in VR using Blender & Unity.
- Interaction tests.
- Data linking.
  
This project combines astronomy and technology interaction to offer students a new learning experience. Allows users to explore how the sky would look like from an exoplanet perspective and taking advantage of star catalogs, showing how this data can be used to understand better our place in the galaxy as well. If we had the possibility of explore the space from any exoplanet, that would add an interactive dimension at the learning moment.

Our project processes images obtained from the provided catalogue and then those images are interpreted in a virtual reality environment, giving the user a better experience in learning about exoplanets. From the NASA database, we obtained SSDS multispectral images (Sloan Digital Sky Survey), obtaining as a result the composition of RGB colors, giving rise to the PNG format.

We hope to reach a good experience where students can learn in a non-theoretical way about exoplanets, but by getting more involved in virtual interactions. To complete this challenge, we use different development software and programming languages such as:
- Unity 2022.3.49f1
- XR Interaction Toolkit 2.6.3
- Meta Quest 3
- Meta Quest Link
- Python
- Blender
- C#
  
Beyond these tools, we used the resources given by NASA, that resources are:
- NASA Exoplanet Archive
- Astroquery
- Astropy
